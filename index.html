                    <h3>How do I Buy Health Insurance?</h3>
                    <p>For some, buying health insurance can be a confusing and overwhelming process. First, you have to
                        find a health insurance plan within your budget. Then you have to contact the company or an
                        insurance agent in order to get a quote. Once you have all of that information, you can evaluate
                        your options. It is a very personal and complicated process, but there are ways to simplify it.
                        <br>
                        Before you settle on a plan, you should first get a quote, find a price, and discover any
                        out-of-pocket expenses your plan will expect you to pay (such as deductibles, co-insurance, and
                        copay charges). Once you have all of this information together, it will be easier to find
                        coverage which fits your needs.å</p>

                    <h4>What is the Healthcare Marketplace?</h4>
                    <p>The passage of the Affordable Care Act established the Healthcare Marketplace. There are two distinct divisions - a state level, and a federal level. 37 states are members of the federal exchange, and 14 are limited to a state exchange. Unfortunately, not all insurance companies are required to provide information about their plans and prices to the Healthcare Marketplace, so be prepared to do some local searching for affordable plans in your area.</p>
                    <p>The Healthcare Marketplace may also be referred to as the Health Insurance Marketplace. It is a website managed by the federal government. When you visit, you can enter a few personal details about yourself and start shopping for plans in a matter of minutes.</p>
                </div>


                <div class="column start-vertical-between labels">
                    <h4>What's the "Health Insurance Exchange"?</h4>
                    <p>The Health Insurance Exchange is the pool of health care plans and providers which are cooperating with the federal government in order to provide affordable health insurance to Americans in many states. 37 states are members of the Exchange on the federal level: AL, AK, AZ, AK, DE, FL, GA, HI, IL, IN, IA, KS, LA, ME, MI, MS, MO, MT, NE, NV, NH, NJ, NM, NC, ND, OH, OK, PA, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VA, WV, WI, and WY.</p>
                    <p>To see if you qualify for a tax subsidy, you need to enroll on the Healthcare Marketplace website (either the federal one, or your state’s website). If you do not qualify for a subsidy for whatever reason, you have the option of shopping through the Exchange or in your state’s private marketplace.</p>

                    <h4>How Can I Find the Best Health Insurance Company?</h4>
                    <p>Right now, there are hundreds of different health insurance companies participating in the Exchange offering thousands of different plans. These companies are rated on a letter grading scale (A, B, C, etc.) based on their performance. Their grade is calculated by attributes such as financial stability, claim payments, and customer service. You might also want to ask around among friends, family members, and colleagues. If their plans are working for them, they could work for you too.</p>

                    <h4>What Happens if I Still Can’t Afford to Buy Health Insurance?</h4>
                    <p>If you cannot purchase insurance, it will be extremely difficult to find Healthcare options in your area. Many doctors don't accept patients without insurance and hospitals have the tendency to charge higher rates to customers without insurance. In emergency situations you will be treated, but you will have little protection from the bills that the hospital charges you.</p>
