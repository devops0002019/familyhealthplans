                    <h3>How do I Buy Health Insurance?</h3>
                    <p>For some, buying health insurance can be a confusing and overwhelming process. First, you have to
                        find a health insurance plan within your budget. Then you have to contact the company or an
                        insurance agent in order to get a quote. Once you have all of that information, you can evaluate
                        your options. It is a very personal and complicated process, but there are ways to simplify it.
                        <br>
                        Before you settle on a plan, you should first get a quote, find a price, and discover any
                        out-of-pocket expenses your plan will expect you to pay (such as deductibles, co-insurance, and
                        copay charges). Once you have all of this information together, it will be easier to find
                        coverage which fits your needs.å</p>

                    <h4>What is the Healthcare Marketplace?</h4>
                    <p>The passage of the Affordable Care Act established the Healthcare Marketplace. There are two distinct divisions - a state level, and a federal level. 37 states are members of the federal exchange, and 14 are limited to a state exchange. Unfortunately, not all insurance companies are required to provide information about their plans and prices to the Healthcare Marketplace, so be prepared to do some local searching for affordable plans in your area.</p>
                    <p>The Healthcare Marketplace may also be referred to as the Health Insurance Marketplace. It is a website managed by the federal government. When you visit, you can enter a few personal details about yourself and start shopping for plans in a matter of minutes.</p>
